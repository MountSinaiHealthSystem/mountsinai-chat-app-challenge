# Mount Sinai Chat App Challenge

In this challenge, we present you with a chat application that may or may not be the best user experience in the biz.

We'd like you to do your best to make this an application ready to face the world, both in it's user-facing experience as well as it's functionality behind the scenes.

If you are applying to a **full-stack** role please approach this challenge in a wholistic way, but if you are applying to a **frontend** or **backend** specific role you can focus your work on those aspects of the chat application respectively.

***Hint:***
After some *extensive* user research we've found many users expect a chat application to have separate chat-rooms, and some users really like being able to see who's typing.

**There's only one rule:**  
The application must use a `React` frontend and a `Golang` backend.
(In case you don't have extensive experience with either of these, rest assured we focus our evaluation on general coding/implementation principles and wont focus on language/framework specific usage details)

**Feel free and you are encouraged to:**  
- Refactor anything you want to make the application a better experience. Add/delete packages and code, go wild with styling, the world is your oyster.

- Add any additional features you think would be cool.

- Add testing to make sure everything works as expected.
