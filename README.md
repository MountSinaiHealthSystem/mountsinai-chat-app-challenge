# Mount Sinai Chat App Challenge

In this challenge, we present you with a chat application that may or may not be the best user experience in the biz.

We'd like you to do your best to make this an application ready to face the world, both in it's user-facing experience as well as it's functionality behind the scenes.

***Hint:***
After some *extensive* user research we've found that the vast majority of users expect a chat application to have separate chat-rooms, and some users really like being able to see who's typing.

**There's only one rule:**  
The application must use a `React` frontend and a `Golang` backend.

**Feel free and encouraged to:**  
- Refactor anything you want to make the application a better experience. Add/delete packages and code, go wild with styling, the world is your oyster.

- Add any additional features you think would be cool.

- Add testing to make sure everything works as expected.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository.
2. install `Golang`, `Node`, and `Yarn` if you don't have them on your system.
3. Swan dive into that code!

## Submitting Your Solution

Simply send us an email at: #####@mountsinai.com with a link to your forked repository.

If there are any additional installation/running steps we need to know about please add them to this file.

Also feel free to list the new features we should check out if you don't think they would be immediately obvious.
