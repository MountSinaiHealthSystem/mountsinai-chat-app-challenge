# Mount Sinai Chat App Challenge

In this challenge, we present you with a chat application that may or may not be the best user experience in the biz. We'd like you to do your best to make this an application ready to face the world, both in it's user-facing experience as well as it's functionality behind the scenes.

***Hint:***
After some *extensive* user research we've found that the vast majority of users expect a chat application to have separate chat-rooms, and some users really like being able to see who's typing.

**There's only one rule:**  
The application must use a `React` frontend and a `Golang` backend.

**Feel free and encouraged to:**  
- Refactor anything you want to make the application a better experience. Add/delete packages and code, go wild with styling, the world is your oyster.

- Add additional features you think would be cool.

- Add testing to make sure everything works as expected.

## Getting Started

Fork this repository, install `Golang`, `Node`, and `Yarn` if you don't have them on your system, and dive into that code!

## Running the Chat Server

In the `/server` directory, you can run:

### `go run main.go`

Runs the chat server on port :8080

### `go test`

## Running the Chat App

In the `/app` directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
